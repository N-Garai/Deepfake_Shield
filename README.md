Deepfake SpyAn advanced, browser-based tool that uses AI to analyze images for signs of deepfake manipulation and digital forgery.📖 OverviewIn an era where digital manipulation is increasingly sophisticated, Deepfake Spy provides a powerful yet easy-to-use solution to scrutinize images. By leveraging a state-of-the-art AI model, this tool performs a detailed forensic analysis, highlighting potential artifacts of AI generation and giving users a clearer picture of an image's authenticity.This entire application runs in the browser, requiring no backend setup or installation.✨ Key Features🤖 AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes Google's powerful Gemini model to conduct a deep forensic analysis of image data.📥 Multiple Input Methods: Analyze images by either dragging and dropping a local file or pasting a direct image URL.📊 Detailed Forensics Report: Get more than just a simple score. The tool breaks down its analysis into categories like Lighting, Skin Texture, and Background Anomalies.🔥 Manipulation Heatmap: Visually identify suspicious regions of an image with an intuitive heatmap overlay that highlights potential areas of manipulation.Metadata Viewer: Inspect the image's EXIF metadata (if available) to find clues about its origin, the device used, and editing software.Modern & Responsive UI: A clean, intuitive, and mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS.⚙️ How It WorksDeepfake Spy is a client-side application that communicates directly with the Google Gemini API.Image Processing: The user's image is converted into a Base64 string directly in the browser. It is not uploaded to any server.Specialized Prompting: A detailed, role-specific prompt is sent to the AI, instructing it to act as a digital forensics expert.API Request: The image data and the prompt are sent to the Gemini API endpoint.Structured Response: The AI analyzes the image and returns a structured JSON object containing the probability score, verdict, detailed breakdown, and heatmap coordinates.Data Visualization: The application parses the JSON response and displays the results in a user-friendly format, including rendering the progress circle, report, and heatmap overlay.🚀 How to UseOpen the index.html file in any modern web browser.Provide an Image:Drag and drop an image file into the designated area.OR paste the URL of an image and click "Fetch Image".Analyze: Once the image preview appears, click the "Analyze Image" button.Review Results: Examine the deepfake probability score, the detailed forensic report, and the visual heatmap overlay on the image.🛠️ Tech StackFrontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)AI Model: Google Gemini APILibraries: exif-js for metadata extraction🖥️ Running LocallyNo complex setup is required.Method 1: Simple File Opening (Recommended)Simply double-click the index.html file to open it in your default web browser.Method 2: Using a Local ServerFor development, it's good practice to use a local server. If you have Python 3 installed:Open a terminal in the project directory.Run the command: python -m http.serverOpen your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.🌐 DeploymentThis is a static web application and can be deployed easily to any static hosting service.VercelNetlifyGitHub PagesSimply link your GitHub repository to one of these services for continuous deployment.📜 DisclaimerThis tool uses AI to estimate the likelihood of an image being a deepfake.
